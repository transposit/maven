# Transposit public maven repository
This repository was created based on the instructions from https://gist.github.com/fernandezpablo85/03cf8b0cd2e7d8527063.
It serves as a public maven repository for open source libraries that we need to fix until the fix is merged and available in the original library repository.

The actual repository is in the `repository` a branch - https://github.com/transposit/maven/tree/repository
